It is a URL shortener web application built using NodeJs, ReactJS, and MongoDB and is deployed on Heroku. It uses the Cloud database MongoDB atlas. It saves the long URL and a mapped short URL in the database and whenever there is a request for that short URL it redirects that request to the long URL. It also stores the number of requests for the short URL which is shown to the user on the dashboard. Users have to log in to generate the short URL. The passwords of the users are hashed in the database and Token-based(JWT) is used. For registering users have to choose a unique username.
